```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

```

I'm an R Markdown document! 

# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:


```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r round(mean(samp),2)`.

```{r}
mean(samp)
round(mean(samp),2)
```

# Section 3

This is going to make a plot!
## Plot for last time
```{r}

plot_df = 
  tibble(
    x = rnorm( n = 1000),
    y = 1 + 2 * x + rnorm( n = 1000)
  )

ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()

```

# Learning assessment
Write a named code chunk that creates a dataframe comprised of: a numeric variable containing a random sample of size 500 from a normal variable with mean 1; a logical vector indicating whether each sampled value is greater than zero; and a numeric vector containing the absolute value of each element. Then, produce a histogram of the absolute value variable just created. Add an inline summary giving the median value rounded to two decimal places. What happens if you set eval = FALSE to the code chunk? What about echo = FALSE?

## Plot for learning assessment
Solution for LA

```{r}
la_df = 
  tibble(
    norm = rnorm( n = 500, mean = 1),
    logical = norm > 0,
    abs_norm = abs(norm) # Google "absolute value r"
  )

ggplot(la_df, aes(x = abs_norm)) + geom_histogram()

median_samp = median(pull(la_df, norm))

round(median_samp, digits = 2) #median value rounded to two decimal places
```
The median of the variable containing absolute values is 
`r round(median_samp, digits = 2)`.
